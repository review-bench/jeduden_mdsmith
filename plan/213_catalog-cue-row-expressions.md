status: "🔲"
summary: >-
  Let `<?catalog?>` row/header/footer templates be CUE
  expressions evaluated against frontmatter, in addition
  to the existing `{path}` placeholder syntax. Unlocks
  list comprehension, ternary, and string interpolation
  so a structured field can render into a generated
  table without an external Go helper.

# MDS019 catalog: CUE-expression row templates

## Goal

Today the `<?catalog?>` `row:` template can interpolate
scalar fields like `{title}` or `{filename}`. It cannot
project a list-typed field. The placeholder resolver in
[`internal/fieldinterp`][fi] walks `map[string]any`
only. It rejects composite leaves on purpose. There is
no syntax for list indexing, list iteration, or
conditional rendering.

The [peer-linter coverage matrix][matrix] is the live
example. Each rule README carries structured peer
mappings:

```yaml
markdownlint:
  - id: MD018
    name: no-missing-space-atx
    default: true
  - id: MD019
    name: no-multiple-space-atx
    default: true
```

The desired cell is
`MD018 ✅ no-missing-space-atx, MD019 ✅ no-multiple-space-atx`.

No combination of today's `{path}` placeholders
produces it. So [`internal/release/coverage.go`][gen]
ships ~360 lines of Go. The release tool walks the
list, formats each entry, and joins the result. The
same shape recurs anywhere a Markdown file needs to
project a list-typed field into a generated table.

After this plan, a row template can be a CUE expression
that runs against the matched file's frontmatter:

```markdown
<?catalog
glob: "internal/rules/MDS*/README.md"
where: 'category: "heading"'
sort: id
row-expr: '
  "| \(id) | " +
  strings.Join(
    [for m in markdownlint {
      "\(m.id) \(if m.default {"✅"} else {"⚪"}) \(m.name)"
    }],
    ", "
  ) + " |"
'
?>
```

CUE handles list comprehension, conditionals, string
interpolation, and `strings.Join`. The `where:`
parameter already evaluates CUE against the same scope.
The evaluator is in place. Only the row, header, and
footer rendering paths need the new branch. Existing
`row:` templates keep working unchanged.

The coverage matrix collapses to a hand-authored
skeleton with one `<?catalog?>` block per category.
The Go generator and its CI drift job delete. Future
call sites — multi-author plan lists, multi-tag
indexes, schema-row tables — pick up the same
capability for free.

## Tasks

1. **CUE evaluator for templates.** Add a function in
   [`internal/fieldinterp`][fi] (or a sibling package).
   It takes a CUE source string. It binds the file's
   frontmatter map as scope. It returns the rendered
   string. Reuse the loader the [catalog parser][parse]
   already uses for `where:`.

2. **New catalog parameters.** Add `row-expr:`,
   `header-expr:`, `footer-expr:`. Each is mutually
   exclusive with its placeholder-style sibling. Setting
   both forms for the same slot is an MDS019
   diagnostic. Document each parameter in the
   [catalog README][catdoc].

3. **Diagnostics.** Surface CUE evaluation errors on
   the directive's opening line. Match the pattern from
   [`bad/where-invalid.md`][badwhere]. A row-expr that
   resolves to a non-string is an error, not a silent
   empty cell.

4. **Documentation.** Update the
   [generating-content guide][guide] with a worked
   example that projects a list-typed field. Add a note
   that contrasts `row:` (scalar fields, simple
   substitution) with `row-expr:` (lists, conditionals,
   derived values).

5. **Migrate the coverage matrix.** Rewrite the
   [matrix page][matrix] as a static skeleton with one
   `<?catalog?>` per category, using `row-expr:`
   against the structured peer-mapping frontmatter.
   Delete [`coverage.go`][gen],
   [`coverage_test.go`][gentest], [`sync_coverage.go`][sub],
   [`sync_coverage_test.go`][subtest], and the
   `coverage-matrix-drift` job in [`ci.yml`][ci].
   `mdsmith check` (via MDS019) is the new drift gate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `row-expr:`, `header-expr:`, `footer-expr:`
  parameters parse and evaluate as CUE against the
  matched file's frontmatter.
- [ ] Setting both `row:` and `row-expr:` on the same
  directive emits an MDS019 diagnostic on the opening
  line.
- [ ] A row-expr that fails to evaluate, returns a
  non-string, or references an unknown field emits an
  MDS019 diagnostic on the opening line. The message
  names the failing field or CUE error.
- [ ] The coverage matrix renders identically to its
  current byte content from `<?catalog?>` blocks
  alone. No `sync-coverage-matrix` is in the loop.
- [ ] [`coverage.go`][gen] and its companions are
  deleted. The `coverage-matrix-drift` job is removed
  from [`ci.yml`][ci]. `mdsmith check .` is the only
  gate.
- [ ] A new fixture under the [catalog rule's good
  fixtures][catgood] exercises a `row-expr` that
  projects a list field via `strings.Join` and a
  ternary.
- [ ] The [generating-content guide][guide] carries a
  worked example of `row-expr:` against a list-typed
  field.
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no issues
- [ ] `go run ./cmd/mdsmith check .` passes
