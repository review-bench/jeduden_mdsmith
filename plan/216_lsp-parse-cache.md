title: Per-document parse cache for the LSP, keyed by version
status: "🔲"
model: opus
depends-on: [198]
summary: >-
  The LSP re-parses the active document on every
  textDocument/didChange. Parse is ~30 % of CPU on
  the corpus benchmark; a per-document cache keyed
  by `(uri, version)` returns the cached
  `*lint.File` when the document text has not
  changed between the runLint trigger and the
  RunSource call. Mirrors the existing RunCache
  seam for cross-file reads, but for the parse
  itself.

# Per-document parse cache for the LSP, keyed by version

## Goal

Add a parse cache keyed by `(absPath, version)`.
On hit, return the cached `*lint.File`. The cache
lives on the LSP `Server`. It has the same
lifetime as the existing
[runCache](../internal/lsp/server.go). The runLint
path consults it before calling
[lint.NewFileFromSource](../internal/lint/file.go).

## Background

`mdsmith lsp` lints the active buffer on every
`textDocument/didChange`. The debounce uses
`time.AfterFunc`. See
[server.go](../internal/lsp/server.go) for the
trigger path. Each trigger calls
[engine.Runner.RunSource](../internal/engine/runner.go).
RunSource parses the document fresh on entry to
`runSourceCheckRules`.

A 5k-line parse takes ~60 ms. The estimate scales
from the 30 % parse share measured on the corpus
benchmark. RunSource latency carries that parse
cost on every keystroke. The cost is redundant
when a debounce fires twice on the same buffer
version. It is also redundant when a non-text LSP
request triggers a re-lint without an intervening
edit. Examples: codeAction, documentSymbol,
definition.

The cross-file
[RunCache](../internal/lint/runcache.go) proves
the seam. It lives for the server lifetime.
Several edit events drop a cached entry. The
parse cache mirrors that shape. The key is denser:
`(absPath, version)`. Version bumps invalidate
the old entry on their own.

## Non-Goals

- Caching parses for the CLI's `mdsmith check`
  path. The corpus is immutable for one process and
  every file is parsed exactly once; a cache costs
  more than it saves.
- A cross-process cache (no disk-backed store).
- Caching across `mdsmith lsp` restarts.
- Caching anything beyond the parsed `*lint.File`.
  Diagnostics depend on config and rule state that
  this cache must not own.

## Design

### Cache shape

```go
// internal/lint/parsecache.go (new file)
type ParseCache struct {
    mu      sync.Mutex
    entries map[string]parseCacheEntry // key: absPath
}

type parseCacheEntry struct {
    version int    // LSP textDocument version
    file    *lint.File
}
```

The cache stores at most one entry per `absPath` —
the most recent version. An LSP edit
monotonically increments the version, so a stored
older entry is always dead on the next miss.

Lookup signature:

```go
func (c *ParseCache) Get(absPath string, version int) (*lint.File, bool)
func (c *ParseCache) Put(absPath string, version int, f *lint.File)
func (c *ParseCache) Invalidate(absPath string)
```

### Wire-in

[engine.Runner](../internal/engine/runner.go)
gains an optional `ParseCache *lint.ParseCache`
field. When set, `RunSource(path, text)` first
checks the cache; on hit, it skips
`lint.NewFileFromSource` and reuses the cached
`*lint.File`. On miss, it parses and stores the
result before continuing.

The LSP `Server` (at
[server.go](../internal/lsp/server.go)) creates
one ParseCache at startup, alongside the existing
`runCache`. It installs the cache on every
`engine.Runner` built for runLint, passing
`document.version` from the `docs` registry into
the RunSource call.

Three handlers drop the entry for the affected
path. The didChange handler reacts to edits. The
didClose handler reacts to buffer close. The
watched-files handler reacts to disk edits. The
didOpen path needs no drop. The version starts
fresh.

### Arena interaction

Plan 198's per-parse arena is held alive by the
parsed AST. A cached `*lint.File` keeps its arena
slabs alive until eviction. The cache caps at one
entry per path, so total live arenas equal the
number of open documents — bounded by the LSP
client. No new pressure beyond what `mdsmith lsp`
already accepts when a document is open and
parsed.

### Concurrency

The LSP serializes runLint per document through
the debounce timer, so two parses of the same
`(path, version)` never race. Cross-document
parses can run concurrently and the cache mutex
serializes their map writes; the `*lint.File`
itself is not shared across paths.

## Tasks

1. Add `internal/lint/parsecache.go` with the
   struct, methods, and unit tests covering Get
   miss, hit, version-mismatch miss, and
   Invalidate.
2. Add `engine.Runner.ParseCache` field and the
   `RunSource` hit/miss branching. Existing tests
   that construct a Runner without setting the
   field must keep passing (nil cache = always
   parse).
3. Wire `s.parseCache` into the LSP `Server`
   alongside `s.runCache`. Pass the document
   version on the RunSource call (extend
   RunSource signature, or introduce
   `RunSourceWithVersion` to avoid churning the
   existing surface — pick whichever keeps
   non-LSP callers untouched).
4. Add invalidation calls in `didChange`,
   `didClose`, and `didChangeWatchedFiles`
   handlers next to the existing `runCache.
   Invalidate` calls.
5. Extend [internal/lsp/bench_test.go](../internal/lsp/bench_test.go)
   with a "warm cache" variant of
   `BenchmarkLatency1kLines` and
   `BenchmarkLatency5kLines` — the second
   RunSource call on the same document version
   must skip the parse and complete faster.
6. Record measured warm-cache latency in this
   plan and tighten the LSP p95 budgets in the
   bench file accordingly (or note why the
   warm-cache path is informational only).

## Risk

A non-LSP caller (test, embedded host) that
mutates the cached `*lint.File` between hits
would observe staleness. Mitigation: the cache is
opt-in via the Runner field; only the LSP
installs one, and the LSP never mutates a
`*lint.File`.

Plan 198's arena-lifetime concern does **not**
apply here. The concern was: AST pointers from
one Parse become invalid on the next Parse on the
same parser. Plan 198 already moved to a per-Parse
arena, GC'd with the AST. A cached `*lint.File`
holds its own arena slabs.

A regression that mis-keys an entry (e.g. forgets
to bump version on a real edit) would serve stale
diagnostics for one cycle until the next edit
fires invalidation. The unit test for
version-mismatch miss is the gate; a contract
test in `internal/lsp/` that walks didChange →
runLint → assert diagnostics reflect new text
catches integration drift.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `internal/lint/parsecache.go` lands with
      unit-test coverage on Get/Put/Invalidate
      and version-mismatch behavior.
- [ ] `engine.Runner.RunSource` returns the same
      diagnostics whether `ParseCache` is nil or
      installed (covered by a contract test that
      runs the same corpus through both paths).
- [ ] LSP `Server` installs the cache, invalidates
      it on didChange/didClose/didChangeWatchedFiles.
- [ ] A "warm cache" variant of
      `BenchmarkLatency5kLines` shows ≥ 20 %
      lower p95 than the cold path (parse share
      eliminated on the warm call) — or the plan
      documents why the measured gain is smaller.
- [ ] Existing cold `BenchmarkLatency1kLines` and
      `BenchmarkLatency5kLines` p95 stays within
      their current budgets (150 ms / 500 ms).
- [ ] A didChange → re-lint integration test
      asserts the second runLint sees the new
      text (no stale diagnostics from a cached
      pre-edit parse).
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no
      issues.
- [ ] `mdsmith check .` passes.
