# MDS023: paragraph-readability

Paragraph readability index must not exceed a threshold.

## Settings

| Setting        | Type  | Default | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ----- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max-index`    | float | 14.0    | Maximum allowed readability index (ARI)                                                                                    |
| `min-words`    | int   | 20      | Minimum word count to check a paragraph                                                                                    |
| `placeholders` | list  | `[]`    | Placeholder tokens to treat as opaque; see [placeholder grammar](../../../docs/background/concepts/placeholder-grammar.md) |

Useful tokens: `var-token`, `heading-question`, `placeholder-section`.

Paragraphs with fewer words than `min-words` are skipped.
Markdown tables and code blocks are skipped.
The Automated Readability Index (ARI) maps to US grade levels:
a score of 14.0 roughly corresponds to college-level text.

## Config

```yaml
rules:
  paragraph-readability: true
```

Custom thresholds:

```yaml
rules:
  paragraph-readability:
    max-index: 12.0
    min-words: 25
```

Disable:

```yaml
rules:
  paragraph-readability: false
```

## Examples

### Good

<?include
file: good.md
wrap: markdown
?>

```markdown
# Simple Document

The cat sat on the mat and the dog lay on the rug and they
were both very happy to be at home on a warm and sunny day
in the middle of the summer.
```

<?/include?>

### Bad

<?include
file: bad.md
wrap: markdown
?>

```markdown
# Complex Document

The implementation of concurrent distributed systems requires sophisticated understanding of fundamental computational paradigms and synchronization mechanisms that must guarantee linearizability across heterogeneous processing environments and architectural configurations.
```
