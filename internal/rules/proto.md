# {id}: {name}

<!-- Rule README template. Copy this file, replace placeholders,
     delete sections and comments that don't apply.
     Front matter is required. The catalog directive reads
     id, name, status, description, nature to generate the rules
     table and filtered listings. The `category:` field is validated
     by mdsmith check against the literal CUE union in this file's
     `category:` front matter, which is hand-kept in sync with
     config.ValidCategories.
     The `markdownlint:`, `rumdl:`, `mado:`, and `panache:` keys
     each list the peer linter's rules that this mdsmith rule
     covers. Each entry has `id:`, `name:`, and a required
     `default:` (whether the peer linter ships the rule enabled
     by default upstream); `partial: true` marks an incomplete
     cover. These per-rule front-matter blocks are the source
     of truth — `mdsmith-release sync-coverage-matrix` renders
     docs/research/markdownlint-coverage/README.md from them.
     Set the key to `null` for tools that have no analog rule.
     Repeat the description verbatim. Use prescriptive voice,
     present tense: "Headings must ..." not "Checks that ...".
     The `nature` key labels the rule's kind. Exactly one of:
       - "directive"  -- implements gensection.Directive
         (MDS019 catalog, MDS021 include, MDS038 toc, MDS039 build).
       - "generator"  -- fixed by introducing or updating a
         generated section authored elsewhere (MDS035 toc-directive).
       - "content"    -- readability, structure, or length checks
         on prose, lists, tables.
       - "style"      -- whitespace, capitalisation, fence/list
         marker choices, blank-line placement.
       - "structure"  -- schema, heading, kind, and cross-file
         structural checks (required structure, single H1, link
         integrity, directory layout). -->

{description}

<!-- Optional: ## Settings
     Include only when rule implements Configurable.
     Type: int, string, list. Description: fragment,
     no period. Delete if not applicable. -->

## Config

<!-- Show enable, disable, and (if configurable) custom
     settings as separate labeled yaml blocks. -->

```yaml
rules:
  rule-name: true
```

Disable:

```yaml
rules:
  rule-name: false
```

<?allow-empty-section?>

## Examples

<!-- Use <?include?> directives referencing fixture files
     in the rule's good/ and bad/ directories (or good.md
     and bad.md files). Use wrap: markdown so the fixture
     renders inside a fenced code block.
     Add ### Good and ### Bad subsections.
     Complex rules: multiple subsections labeled
     "### Good -- description" or "### Bad -- description".
     Always use include directives for examples. When the
     included output cannot show the difference (e.g., EOF
     newline in MDS009), add explanatory prose after the
     include. -->

<!-- Optional: ## Diagnostics
     Include when the rule emits more than one distinct
     message. Delete for single-message rules. -->

<!-- Optional: ## Edge Cases
     Include for complex rules. Delete otherwise. -->

## Meta-Information

- **ID**: {id}
- **Name**: `{name}`
- **Status**: {status}
- **Default**: enabled
- **Fixable**: no
- **Implementation**:
  [source](./)
- **Category**: {category}
- **Markdownlint**: [MDxxx][mdl-mdxxx] (name)

[mdl-mdxxx]: https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/mdxxx.md

<!-- Bullets in this order: ID, Name, Status, Default, Fixable,
     Implementation, Category, Markdownlint, and optionally Concept.
     Default may include key settings: "enabled, max: 80".
     Category must match the `category:` front-matter field and one
     of the values in ValidCategories. Pick the narrowest that fits;
     drop any category not in this list.
     The Markdownlint bullet mirrors the `markdownlint:` front-matter
     list. One entry per markdownlint rule the mdsmith rule covers,
     joined with commas; "(partial)" suffixes a partial cover. The
     matching link-reference definition follows the bullet block.
     Omit the Markdownlint bullet (and the link refs) for mdsmith-only
     rules with `markdownlint: null` in front matter.
     Add a Concept bullet when the rule has a dedicated concept page:
       - **Concept**: [NAME](../../../docs/background/concepts/NAME.md)
     Omit the Concept bullet when no concept page applies. -->
